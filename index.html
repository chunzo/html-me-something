                    <p>It all begin in 5th or 6th grade. While playing DOTA, I became friends with a person named Frank. Frank invited me to play Counter-Strike with him. I wasn't very good at it but Frank asked me if I wanted to play as a backup on his CAL(Cyberathlete Amateur League) Open team. This was my first taste of competitive gaming. I played in a few matches, did poorly, but we still made the playoffs in the end. Unfortunately, this was the last season the team was playing and we disbanded after losing in the playoffs.</p>

                    <p>In 2012, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was released. Many veteran players of the series were hesitant to switch making it an ideal game to start fresh in. I played with a group of friends in ESEA's first season of CS:GO. We ended up making the playoffs but lost in playoffs going 2-2. The next season, I decided to play with different people as I found out that playing with friends makes it hard to be objective when discussing why things aren't working out. We made it into playoffs again and eventually lost to the team that won the whole thing. After this season, I decided to call it quits and played a few more seasons just for fun.</p>

                    <p>When Overwatch was announced, I wasn't sure if the game would have a competitive scene so I wasn't expecting much. However, when I waas at Dreamhack Austin, the open beta was out and a tournament was going to be held. I entered with a group of friends and placed second. This changed my mind about the game and I decided to go all out with Overwatch. When the game released in May of 2016, I joined a team and we began practicing immediately. The team started off great. We won several scrims against the top teams and won a few small online tournaments. Things just began falling apart from there. Since the goal of the team was to eventually go pro, we started replacing players after not improving after a week or two. With new players, we were improving but that would only last a short while since we didn't keep the same players long enough to build chemistry. Three or four months after release the team disbanded. We went through many roster changes and the core that stayed got tired of not showing progress.</p>

                    <p>I don't regret giving up what most people would call a 'life' in pursuit of my dream in becoming a professional gamer. I made a lot of friends and have a few connections in the e-sports world. Now it's time for me to move on and with LaunchCode, I'm looking forward to entering the programming world.</p>
